## Project: LABUBUS Ecommerce Website

We are building an **MVP ecommerce website** that sells LABUBUS products.  
The MVP will be delivered in **3 sprints**. Each sprint should produce working, testable code.  
The focus is on **simplicity, speed, and functionality** â€” not on overengineering.

---

## Goals
- Build an ecommerce MVP that lets customers **browse LABUBUS products, add them to cart, and checkout**.  
- Provide a lightweight **admin flow** to manage products and orders.  
- Ensure the site is **mobile-friendly, fast, and cleanly branded**.  
- Use common frameworks/tools that speed up development (not reinventing the wheel).

---

## Core MVP Features (to be completed across 3 sprints)
1. **Product Catalog**  
   - Product listings, categories/filters (if needed), product detail pages.  

2. **Shopping Cart & Checkout**  
   - Add/remove items, view cart, checkout flow (shipping + payment).  
   - Payment gateway integration (Stripe or PayPal).  

3. **Order Management (Admin)**  
   - Simple dashboard to view orders and update statuses.  
   - Lightweight inventory tracking.  

4. **Brand Pages**  
   - Homepage (brand story, featured products, CTA).  
   - About page.  
   - Contact page (form or email).  

5. **Basic Marketing Hooks**  
   - Newsletter signup (email capture).  
   - Discount code support (basic).  

---

## Constraints
- **Prioritize working code** over polish.  
- **Each sprint must deliver testable output.**  
- Use widely adopted frameworks/tools (React + Next.js, or a proven ecommerce starter kit).  
- Keep dependencies lightweight unless critical.  
- Do not build features outside the MVP scope.  

---

## Sprint Plan
- **Sprint 1**: Project setup, product catalog, homepage skeleton.  
- **Sprint 2**: Shopping cart + checkout flow + payment integration.  
- **Sprint 3**: Admin dashboard, polish (mobile responsive, branding, marketing hooks).  

---

## Deliverables
- Code in a structured repo (with clear READMEs).  
- Working local dev environment instructions.  
- After each sprint: running version with the completed features.  

---

## Communication
- Follow prompts that define the scope of each sprint.  
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous.  
- Always favor **MVP simplicity** over extra complexity.
